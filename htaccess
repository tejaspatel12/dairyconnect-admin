Setting the HTTPS Redirection
Ensure that the Digital Certificate is properly installed on your Hosting Order, and the site is resolving on https://girorganic-admin.in.

NOTE
Your site will work on https://girorganic-admin.in or https://www.girorganic-admin.in or https://manage.girorganic-admin.in, depending on the Common Name for which you had the certificate issued. Resolving HTTPS on anything other than this Common Name would result in a certificate name mismatch error.

Create a .htaccess file under the site's directory and add the following lines to it. In case there already exists a .htaccess in your site's directory, carefully edit it to add these lines:

RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off 
RewriteRule (.*) https://<common_name>%{REQUEST_URI}



<common_name> needs to be replaced by the Common Name for which the Digital Certificate is issued.
